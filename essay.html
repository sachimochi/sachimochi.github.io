<p class="one" id="a"> During 3500 to 500 BCE, <i> social </i> systems mainly helped support social discipline in India. The social systems first started when Aryans and Dravidians started to have conflicts within one another. It was based on the color of one’s skin. However, Aryans and Dravidians started to mix, interact, and intermarry within each other, so they were less distinct from each other as time went on. Therefore, the social systems started to be based on one’s occupation. The social systems influenced how an Indian can interact with other people. An individual can only interact with other people in his jati. If he interacts with people of other castes, he will be shunned by people of higher castes.

	<p class="one" id="b" >Interaction with nature had a huge role in the development of new civilizations. The Harappans got its water from the snow and rain from the mountains, and they utilized the water for agricultural purposes. The Aryans used livestock for transportation and food. And agricultural advances led both of these societies to a population boost. However, the Harappan negatively interacted with the environment by deforestation, which led to their downfall.

     <p class="one" id="c"> Literature, the arts, and religion affected the creativity of the societies in India. Due to the rulers’ great power, they had authority in many citadels. Even though the Harappans have fallen, their handicraft was the only part of them that survived. Also, people were able to trade far and wide with their handicraft work.

      <p class="one" id="d"> Literature, interaction with nature, and social systems intervened with each other during 3500 to 500 BCE. For example, they all had a role in introducing foreigners. The caste system will get them used to the society, they would get food from agriculture, and they would be entwined with the religion.
